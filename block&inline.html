        <h3>It is used as a container for other HTML elements</h3>
        <p>HTML Block elements, are used to structure the main content of a webpage. They typically start on a new line
            and take up the full width of their container examples div, p, h1 to h6, and ul, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>This is a demo of Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>Span elements is an inline container used to markup a part of text or document</p>
    <p> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> An inline element</span> is the opposite of the block-level
        element. It does not start on a new line and takes up only
        the necessary width ie., it only occupies the space bounded by the tags defining the HTML element, instead of 
        breaking the flow of the content. </p>
